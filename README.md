# Weather-forecast
Developed a responsive weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data from the OpenWeather API. The app allows users to search for weather information by city or country, displaying current conditions and a 4-day forecast with dynamic animations and a user-friendly interface.
